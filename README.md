# nft-eth-comp

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are one of the assets that are largely denominated in cryptocurrency. Typically, NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain are bought and sold on major marketplaces using ETH, while those on Solana are largely traded in SOL. This has given rise to the belief that crypto-assets, in this case, serve as a true unit of account.

Drawing from large datasets on NFT sales (particularly a16z's [NFT Analyst Starter Pack](https://github.com/a16z/nft-analyst-starter-pack)), we investigate the relationship between major NFT project floor prices and fluctuations in the unit of account's exchange rate. How do NFT speculators *actually* price these assets?
